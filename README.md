🚴‍♂️ **Bike Sales Performance Analysis**

![Dashboard Preview](dashboard_preview.png)

**Problem Statement**

The objective of this project was to analyze a retail bike sales dataset comprising 1,200+ orders to understand sales performance and delivery efficiency. 
The business needed to identify its most profitable regions, top-performing product lines, and any potential bottlenecks in the supply chain (delivery times) to optimize operations for the upcoming fiscal year.

**The Analysis Process**

I utilized Excel (Pivot Tables, Power Query) to process and analyze the sales data.

Validated order dates, delivery dates, and financial metrics across 1,200 records.

Developed core metrics including Total Revenue ($2.31M), Profit ($1.55M), Total Orders (1,201), and Average Days to Delivery (5.9 days).

Analyzed monthly revenue trends from July to December to identify seasonal peaks.

Broke down revenue and profit by Customer Country and State.

**Key Insights (Q&A)**

**Question**: Which region is our strongest market?

**Answer**: Australia is the top-performing country, generating over $912k in revenue, followed by the United States ($787k). Together, they account for the majority of global sales.

**Question**: What is the most profitable product category?

**Answer**: Road Bikes are the clear leader, generating **$1.91M in revenue** compared to Mountain Bikes ($398k). Specifically, the "Road-150" series (Red) is a top contributor to profit.

**Question**: How efficient is our logi**stics network?

**Answer**: The average delivery time is consistently around 6 days (5.94 days average). However, there is slight variability month-over-month (e.g., August peaked at ~6.2 days), which warrants monitoring.

**Question**: When is our peak sales period?

**Answer**: July was the strongest month with $557k in revenue, significantly outperforming subsequent months. This suggests a strong mid-year seasonal demand.

**Recommendations**

**Why did it happen?**

The dominance of "**Road Bikes**" suggests a customer base focused on performance cycling rather than off-road/leisure. The strong performance in Australia and the US indicates successful market penetration in these mature markets, while the July peak correlates with summer cycling season in the Northern Hemisphere (and end-of-financial-year sales in Australia).

**What should we do next?**

**Inventory Focus**: Prioritize stock levels for Road Bikes (Road-150 series) in the Australian and US warehouses before July to maximize the peak season opportunity.

**Market Expansion**: With the UK and Germany lagging significantly behind the US/Australia (e.g., Germany at ~$147k), launch targeted marketing campaigns in Europe to capture untapped market share.

**Logistics Optimizatio**n: While a 6-day delivery average is acceptable, investigate the August delivery spike (6.2 days) to prevent delays during future high-volume periods.
